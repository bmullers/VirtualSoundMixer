# VirtualSoundMixer

### A little project that's pretty much exactly what the name implies

Except, of course, the fact that it will not look like a real mixer at all but more like a mess of Swing sliders and labels

This software is currently in development, and will not be usable for a **long time**, even for testing purposes.

It uses LWJGL and is based on the OpenAL API

#### However, here is a little description of what it will do :

This software will provide the user with a virtual multi-channel mixer. Each channel has room for one sound sample, and comes with pitch and gain modifiers, a customizable direct filter and several (number not yet determined) auxiliary send which can be attached to effect slots. The mixer has room for 4 (number will be modified later on) effect slots. Each effect slot has room for one custom effect and has a customizable filter.

The program will allow you to create custom effects in the effect slots, load samples into the channels, attach effect slots to auxiliary sends and modify filters as you please. It will also let you play each channel individually or all at the same time.

Effect types supported :

* reverb
* chorus
* distortion
* ~~echo~~
* ~~flanger~~
* ~~frequency shifter~~
* ~~vocal morpher~~
* ~~pitch shifter~~
* ~~ring modulator~~
* ~~autowah~~
* ~~compressor~~
* ~~equalizer~~

#### Why I work on this project

I started this project as a way to learn Kotlin and get better at using OpenAL and at programming in general. It follows my desire to participate in the [Cunk Stories](https://github.com/Hugobros3/chunkstories) project, which is currently being rewritten in Kotlin.

#### About this project

It is entirely open source.
